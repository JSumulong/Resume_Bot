# Jon's Resume Bot

## Purpose
This Rails app is meant to serve as the backend for a Facebook integrated Messenger bot. As of now, the bot responds to anything with a set of default options to learn more about me, my skills as a web developer, and the projects that I have worked on. This project was born out of curiosity about bots and transformed into something kinda fun and somewhat practical.

## What I learned
I learned a lot about connecting a webserver with Facebook and the approval process of getting a Facebook app approved for public interaction (e.g., webhooks, privacy policies, etc...). But more specifically, I learned about the Messenger platform and the kind of formats that a Facebook Messenger bot can respond with (e.g., templates, urls, subtitles, buttons, and postbacks).
